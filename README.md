# Instagram-user-analytics
The following project is an analysis of Instagram users and
multiple insights drawn from the same. Teams from
throughout the company utilise these information to
develop new marketing campaigns, choose which features
to include in apps, gauge the performance of the apps by
looking at user interaction, and generally improve the user
experience while assisting in business expansion.

To complete the following project I have used a very
straight forward and to the point approach; I understood
the requirements of the project thoroughly and designed a
rough mind map for the same as to how will I go about the
project. Once I finished learning all the theory component,
I decided to try hands-on learning and installed mySQL for
the same. I am currently using the community version of
mySQL and mySQL workbench for my project. This is the
version of mySQL that I am using: macOS 12 (x86, 64-bit),
